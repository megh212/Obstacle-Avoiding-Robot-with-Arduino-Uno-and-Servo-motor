**# About**
An obstacle avoiding robot is an intelligent device, which can automatically sense and overcome obstacles on its path and protect the robot from any physical damages. IR module is used to avoid the obstacle if it comes in front of IR module. The idea is simple and works without micro controller. That means we can make it without any sort of coding and the circuit allows us to use any DC motor regardless of its power, so even high power obstacle avoiding vehicles could be made using this circuit which are normally used in malls and similar retail outlets.
#Main components
1 Arduino UNO,
1 Ultrasonic Sensor module (HCSR04).
controlled by:
Motor Driver IC L293D (2 wheeled).
There are many algorithms for avoiding obstacles using many sensors and controllers. There are various sensors such as laser sensors, various sensors using various mmWave, EM wave bands and other wave techniques, There are even imaging techniques with object detections, image recognition and identification techniques, SONAR technique, RADAR technique and many more. Sometimes there are more than one sensors being used, In some cases, a combination of sensors are even being used.
